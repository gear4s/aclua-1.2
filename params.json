{"name":"Sveark's Assault Cube Lua for v1.2+","tagline":"Servermod","body":"## Welcome to Lua Mod's home page\r\nThis is the home page for Assault Cube's [Lua Mod](http://sveark.info/ac/Lua/) (by sveark) updated to 1.2+\r\n\r\n### Who's the guy that done this?\r\nHis in-game and online nickname is Narwhaal, and he's usually on the IRC channel #graphox.us on GameSurge\r\n\r\n### Why did he do this?\r\nBoredom, mostly. He also was tired of the lack of 1.2+ servermods, so he ported sveark's Lua mod.\r\n\r\n### What's the future plans ?\r\nWell, upgrade obviously. I plan to upgrade the Lua implementation to 5.2, and also clean up the original source. Then I plan on adding features, like, an IRC bot and webadmin interface.\r\n\r\n### Do you have any help with any of the above features, or did you when porting ?\r\nNo, I've so far done all porting/implementing myself, but I had some support from B}PhaNtom :)\r\n\r\n### Does Sveark know about this port ?\r\nMaybe, maybe not. I've posted info about it on Assault Cube's forum, so if he's there, he knows this.","google":"UA-45971771-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
